  <DMS_MechLink.description>A man-made bionic implant that allows for the direct control of mechanoids. No one knows if it is the early model of Mechlink technology or its reverse engineered product by later generations. Anyways it is a proper mechlink in all degrees but one that humans based in technologically-disparate rimworlds can understand and imitate.

Due to processing precision issues, these imitations from rimworlds often have some side effects after installation...</DMS_MechLink.description>
