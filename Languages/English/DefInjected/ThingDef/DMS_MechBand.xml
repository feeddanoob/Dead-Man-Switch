  <DMS_BandNode.description>An array machine processes the received signal and directs it to a specific mechanitor. This adds 4 bandwidth to that mechanitor's total, allowing them to control more mechanoids.

Once a process array is constructed, it can be quickly tuned to a mechanitor. However, returning a band node to a different mechanitor takes significantly longer.

This Device follows the N.A.C.S. protocol so only Mechlinks with following the protocol can receieve the service.</DMS_BandNode.description>
