  <!-- EN: A phase array radar. Once activated, it puts out a powerful wave radiation signal which will attract a feral automatroid to attack along with its escorts. If you can defeat it, you can collect the advanced technology from its corpse. The signal pulse burns out the transmitter, so this building can only be used once. -->
