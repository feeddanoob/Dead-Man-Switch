        <li>questDescription->[faction_name] is ready to grant [pawn_definite] the title of [newTitle] in a promotion ceremony.\n\nThe officiator of the ceremony will arrive by shuttle to perform the ceremony.\n\nThe officiator will only give a title if there exists a throneroom meeting the requirements of the position. There's a chance of gaining extra honor depending on how many viewers attend the ceremony. Additionally, every viewer gains a mood bonus.\n\nYou can betray the officiator but this will make [faction_name] your enemy.\n\nIf you miss or fail this ceremony, there will be another opportunity later. If the officiator or guards are harmed for any reason, there will be diplomatic consequences.</li>
