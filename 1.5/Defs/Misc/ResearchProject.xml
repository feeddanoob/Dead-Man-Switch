    <description>After the discovery of the Dead Man's Switch, an AI algorithm engineer proposed a hypothetical solution to the halting problem caused by a loss of directional control of the automatroids. \n\n Wetware was created as a proof of concept, serving as an organic brain activated in a series with the Dead Man's Switch enabling Automatroids to awaken and continue fighting after their operator has died. Preliminary tests indicated a portion of the operator's personality was transposed into the Automatroid- but such reports dissapeared as quickly as they were made.
