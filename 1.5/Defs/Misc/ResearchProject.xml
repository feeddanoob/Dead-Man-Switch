    <label>Wetware Hypothesis</label>
    <description>After the discovery of the Dead Man's Switch, an AI algorithm engineer Yánzhi Jiang proposed a hypothetical solution to the halting problem. \n\n Wetware was created as a proof of concept, serving as an organic brain activated in a series with the Dead Man's Switch enabling Automatroids to awaken and continue fighting after their operator has disabled. Preliminary tests indicated a portion of the operator's personality was transposed into the Automatroid- but such reports dissapeared as quickly as they were made. Allows for the construction of Decoy Radars and heavier Automatroids, as well as the synthesis of Wetware Computers.</description>

    <description>A series of Arquebusier model Automatroids designed for urban warfare, these models boast heavy armor, lightning fast mobility, and a punishing array of compatible weaponry. This line of Automatroids excel in urban environments and close quarters combat, but can also work as less lethal peacekeepers and riot control units.</description>

    <description>Weapons development centered around biomechanical hybrids continued until World War IV, where it had reached incomprehensible heights.\n\nThis was the beginning of the next-generation weapons that would ultimately lead to the destruction of the planet. Unlocks the Tarbosaurus, a fearsome predatory Automatroid shaped after the mighty carnotaurus capable of hosting enough firepower to destroy entire cities if left unchecked.</description>
