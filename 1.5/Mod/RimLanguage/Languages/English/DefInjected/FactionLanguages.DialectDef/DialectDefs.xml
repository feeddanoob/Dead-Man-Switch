  <!-- EN: A highly lossless interstellar communication language that is used to compress messages. It is the standard coding protocol used by colonial fleets for near-light-speed communications. A simplified version is used by fleet members for oral communication and written records. It uses 214 radicals to form about 5,000 commonly used characters and about 30,000 uncommon characters, and communicates and records information by combining characters. This language has almost no grammatical exceptions and can naturally create things and meanings that do not yet exist based on its internal rules. And its standard rules are still being slowly and uniformly iterated today as communications between colonial fleets occur. -->
