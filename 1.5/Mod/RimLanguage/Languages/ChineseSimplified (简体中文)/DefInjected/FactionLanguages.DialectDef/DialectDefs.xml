  <!-- EN: A highly lossless interstellar communication language that is used to compress messages. It is the standard coding protocol used by colonial fleets for near-light-speed communications. A simplified version is used by fleet members for oral communication and written records. It uses 214 radicals to form about 5,000 commonly used characters and about 30,000 uncommon characters, and communicates and records information by combining characters. This language has almost no grammatical exceptions and can naturally create things and meanings that do not yet exist based on its internal rules. And its standard rules are still being slowly and uniformly iterated today as communications between colonial fleets occur. -->
  <DMS_Fleet_Standard.description>一种能高度无损压缩讯息的星际通讯用语言，是殖民舰队用于近光速通讯用的标准编码协议，其简化的版本可以直接用于口语与书写交流。其使用214种部首来组成约5000种常用字元与大约30000种不常用字元，并透过组合字元来进行交流与讯息纪录。\n\n这种语言几乎没有文法例外并且可以根据其内部规则自然创造出尚未存在的事物与意义。而组合的名词库如今依然在随着殖民舰队之间的通讯而缓慢且统一的迭代。</DMS_Fleet_Standard.description>
